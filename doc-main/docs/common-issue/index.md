# Common Issue

## Modify `clear_cache_freq` to Reduce GPU Memory Pressure

If you find that your GPU memory is insufficient—especially if the program consistently runs out of memory after several episodes (during data collection or evaluation)—try adjusting the `clear_cache_freq` parameter in the corresponding task configuration.
Note that setting a smaller `clear_cache_freq` value can reduce GPU memory usage but may also slow down runtime performance (For more details, see [Configurations](https://
robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/configurations.html)).

## `[svulkan2] [error] OIDN Error: invalid handle`

Try [[SAPIEN issue: https://github.com/haosulab/SAPIEN/issues/243](https://github.com/haosulab/SAPIEN/issues/243)], or modify the `clear_cache_freq` into `1`.

## Stuck While Collecting Data and Evaluating

> According to the feedback, you can try to remove the “pencil” object (`assets/objects/objaverse/pencil` folder). This is said to resolve most issues, though the reason remains unclear. We have updated the object dataset on the Huggingface also.

Please check your GPU model. According to user feedback and known issues reported on SAPIEN [[SAPIEN issue: https://github.com/haosulab/SAPIEN/issues/219](https://github.com/haosulab/SAPIEN/issues/219)], Hopper/Ampere series GPUs (e.g., A100, H100) may occasionally experience unexpected hangs during data collection. 

You can run `python data/process_stuck.py ${task_name} ${task_config} ${seed_id}` to skip the specific seed and rerun the data collection script. You can identify the `${seed_id}` from the terminal output. For example, if you get stuck at `saving: episode = 478  index = 105`, then `478` is the `${seed_id}`. This will replace the affected seed (in `data/${task_name}/${task_config}/seed.txt`) and trajectory data (in `data/${task_name}/${task_config}/_traj_data/`) with the last seed and episode data. **IMPORTANT:** this may result in insufficient episode data, so please modify the `episode_num` parameter in the task config to collect more seeds and ensure the final dataset has enough episodes.
